Project Media Management system

The idea for this project was born during a brainstorm session with Stichting Talent And Dreams (STAD) Alkmaar, 
as a means to open-source the generated ideas. In cooperation with PMM Media we added the media functions 
in order to evaluate the results of the projects that came to fruition.
